Most recent updates:
<li>Updated launcher icon</li>
<li>Added a toolbar! And paid close attention to material ui recommendations</li>
  <li>Back buttons are now within the toolbar when appropriate</li>
  <li>It has been stylized with a logo and overflow menu to log out</li>
  <li>The overflow menu has a rounded green background to look a hint less boring</li>
<li>Removed the downloaded logo to replace with a unique one</li>
<li>Worked on fixing some kinks that usually involved navigating between activities</li>
<li>Did explore adding photos and filtering but that opens a gigantic can of worms that would be very unsatisfying to leave wriggling</li>
<p></p>
Current activities:
<li>Add a garden</li>
<li>View a list of gardens with quick reference to their size and light</li>
<li>View all plants in each garden, seeing their type, height, light, and bloom time</li>
